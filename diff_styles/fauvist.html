                    <p class="postText">Hi! My name's Becky Greubel, joining this class from Southwest Colorado. I'm in my final semester of the AAS Communication 
                        Design program. I have a pretty healthy amount of coding experience, but I haven't explored 
                        the generative nature of the web much, and am excited to do so in this class, as well as 
                        express myself artistically through the web.<br><br>
                    There's so many fun and weird websites on the web. Some of my favorites are:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://indirect.flights/">Indirect Flights</a> - I love the materiality of the website and the mixing of both physical nd digital elements.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://pointerpointer.com/">Pointer Pointer</a> - simple, goofy, fun, basically everything I love in everything</li>
                    <li><a href="https://lrsphm.github.io/poem-club/index.html">Poem Club</a> - I love the idea of the web as a medium to explore poetry and storytelling, and using more simple solutions to achieve your desired effect.</li>
                </ul> </p>

                    <h2 class="postTitle">Paul Chan + His Letter to Young Artists During a Global Pandemic</h2>
                    <p class="postText"> Throughout Paul Chan's letter, I reflected on what my internal conceptions of home include, 
                        even in terms of school work and coding. On a personal level, the pandemic has made me really consider my presence and the space I take, 
                        particularly on digital platforms, as well as caused me to challenge some of habits that I had formed and if they were truly serving me. 
                        This was most readily apparent in my relationship with social media and how it at times energerized me, but most of the time, sucked energy from me. 
                        His question of <span class="quote">"Is there a direction that doesn't point backward?"</span> resonnated with my experience reshaping my relationship with social platforms, 
                        that rather than regressing to using them as staples for feeling a sense of connectedness (albeit many times creating a facade of connectedness, 
                        instead of true connectedness), reimagining what my relationship with it could be that doesn't include a dependency on social media as a 
                        means to feel together with others.<br><br>
                        On a school and coding level, his article made me question my habits and routines of relying on the same conventions, visual languages and structures 
                        in my code and in my work writ large. Two quotes in particular that struck me profoundly were <span class="quote">"Trouble is what you find and what 
                        you must endure if you wish to gain an identity"</span> and <span class="quote">"How we think aout what we're doing changes how we do it, and ends up 
                        reshaping us in the mix."</span> In this class, I hope to create more trouble for myself by pushing outside my conventions of what a website or code 
                        should look like, and allowing myself to be reshaped in the process.<br><br>
